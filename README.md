- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ Song.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in making something for the world.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working and learing on...   

I'm a Freelancer with over 7 Years of Web and Mobile app Development Experience.
Also I have 6 years of Embedded system development experience as well from university hood.

1. Web development::
You have a project and you need a Web Developer or Designer that can work on your project. And here's the kicker, your project may need a specific skillset like:
- Front End (React.js, Next.js, Vue.js)
- Node || Laravel || Golang || Django Backend & API || AWS Lambda
- WordPress Full stack
- Block Chain(Solidity, Rust : KYC, NFT, Dapp, DeFi)
- DB:: MySQL, MongoDB, SQLite, Firebase, DynamoDB
Most times you find a person who specializes in one or the other and then you need to find a second developer to get your project done.
But... you're in luck because you just found a one-stop-shop!
I've worked on everything from Small Web Apps for businesses to Enterprise Sized Web Platforms.
Also, I specialize in WordPress Web Design, Development, Custom Premium Themes, ECommerce, and WooCommerce. And because I have a diverse set of skills, I can tackle any project you have.
