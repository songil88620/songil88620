- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ Song.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in making something for the world.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working and learing on...   

I'm a Freelancer with over 7 Years of Development Experience. 

1. Web development::
You have a project and you need a Web Developer or Designer that can work on your project. And here's the kicker, your project may need a specific skillset like:
- Front End (React.js, Next.js, Vue.js)
- Node(NestJS) || PHP(Laravel) || Go(Jin) || Python(Django) & API || AWS Lambda
- Dapp(Typescript, web3.js, ether.js)
- WordPress Full stack
- Block Chain(Solidity, Rust, NFT, Dapp, DeFi)
- DB:: MySQL, MongoDB, SQLite, Firebase, DynamoDB
Most times you find a person who specializes in one or the other and then you need to find a second developer to get your project done.
But... you're in luck because you just found a one-stop-shop!
I've worked on everything from Small Web Apps for businesses to Enterprise Sized Web Platforms.
Also, I specialize in WordPress Web Design, Development, Custom Premium Themes, ECommerce, and WooCommerce. And because I have a diverse set of skills, I can tackle any project you have.

2. Mobile app development::
- iOS (Flutter/ Swift) | Android (Flutter /JAVA / Kotlin)
- OOP, FRP, Protocol Oriented Programming, Reactive Programming
- Architecture Patterns: MVC, MVP, MVVM
- 3rd party frameworks for iOS and Android
